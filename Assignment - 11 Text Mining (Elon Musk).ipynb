He understood the right questions to ask  RT   U0001F923 U0001F923 BDE How come Hulk never loses pants   Yes No prior neuroscience background is required  This is primarily an electrical  electronic  chip design   me  RT  Targeting Monday  July 20 for Falcon 9 launch of ANASISII from SLC  40 Solving highvolume  highreliability  lowcost production problems is especially valued If you \\x92 ve solved hard problems with phones  wearables  sealing  signal processing  inductive charging  power mgmt   Many Summarizes pretty much every biz school case study It \\x92 s inevitable  Excuse me  I only sell Doge  Will those who write the algorithms ever realize their negativity bias  Pretty much We better hustle with Neuralink  Not moving fast enough  Thanks Just stop U0001F495 U0001F495 U0001F923 U0001F923 Gigafactory is the product even more than the car Yes Carefully hidden Sure Might be an indoor  outdoor rave space on the roof Giga Berlin  Exactly  this is a serious problem  Ratio of retirees to workers is  Considering Small note  latch on post near base is gone  powered Ethernet wire is less obtrusive in production version  This thing we call \\x93 money \\x94 is just a  slow  lossy  unsecure  database for labor allocati  Trying to set a good example haha  Mars needs people  Great work by Tesla software engineering Population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after AI imo Yeah  will take less than a minute to order on  when it goes live Starlink terminal has motors to selforient for optimal view angle  No expert installer required   Ok U0001F914  Exactly Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation  Also  what about Autobahn   The strength  perseverance of the people of Tesla  despite facing extreme difficulties Playable on any Tesla  Should do this automatically Mass to orbit is a more accura  Cute Wow Reusability is essential  A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane  F9 e  Wild times  We \\x92 re being extra paranoid  Maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount  Welcome anytime Well  I do care very much about sustainability of civilization  but there is some truth to the irony part haha Yes  in plan  Superchargers and public high power wall c  U0001F440 I think so Doing range testing now  Number will be significantly higher than 300  Extreme  We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor  will offer a LR single moto  Yes It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge No  as range would be unacceptably low   250 mile EPA  We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S  X to reduce resistive heating  Technically    Thanks  That is the nearterm danger of AI I didn \\x92 t mind DA2  DA1 was awesome  Mass Effect 2  talking about sequels  is amazing  Haha Maybe he should design flag of Mars 48 65 78 20 74 6f 20 74 65 78 74  I spoke with Korolev \\x92 s family today  He was one of the very best  U041A U043E U0440 U043E U043B U044C U043E U0432  U041A U043E U0440 U043E U043B U0451 U0432  In general  we need to improve how podcasts play SPQR  True haha Death is the loss of information Earning power post augmentation would easily pay for itself  if that \\x92  Absolutely U0001F440 Probably a good one to design  engineer in Germany Even more Ok U0001F440 Berlin Model Y is the one to watch  That is a revolution in automotive body engineering  finally   True Wow  IHOP  GitHub are close Best use of the term \\x93 Full Stack \\x94  For sure  This is both great  terrifying  Everything we \\x92 ve ever sensed or thought has been  Yes Sorry  should hopefully be soon  Not actually a payout  just a vesting of stock options  It may never pay out  as the stock can \\x92 t b  No easy way to answer this in a tweet  but helping with dire brain injuries is our first priority  Details Aug 28  AI symbiosis while u wait There \\x92 s some of that too True  it sounds so surreal  but the negative propaganda is still all out there  easy to find in social me  Make sure to read ur terms  conditions before clicking accept  Samwise Gamgee Altho Dumb and Dumber is U0001F525 U0001F525 Progress update August 28'"
